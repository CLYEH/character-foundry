"""Pydantic DTOs for the Motion resource (T-033, api-shape §6.5).

`video_url` and `thumbnail_url` are signed URLs minted at read time —
the storage `video_key` on the model is never exposed (storage-layout §5).
Same convention as Checkpoint / Base / Alias DTOs.

`motion_type` and `MotionParentType` are reused from `app.schemas.prompt`
so the discriminator literal stays identical between the prompt-preview
surface (T-035) and the create / read surfaces here. A future preset
addition flips both endpoints in one place.
